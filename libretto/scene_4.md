# Scene 4

Setting: In the garden; at the Dean's house

[Jay enters humming the motet the Nightingale had sung in the previous scene. The Nightingale had learned the song from the college's choir. Jay suddenly notices there is a red rose on the ground next to a dead bird.]

## The Unhappy Duet

**Jay**:

What luck! What joy!

A red so deep -- oh, it's carmine!

Never seen one like it in all my life!

A blessed rose for my blessed Alice!

[Jay runs off with the red rose. In the transition, Tom walks down the street whistling the May Madrigal. We cut to the Dean's house, where Alice is on the telephone with Gail.]

**Alice**:

What luck! What joy!

He gave me banquets of roses

and bracelets of pearls. Of course I said yes!

Oh Gail, come and see the gown I've picked.

[Jay knocks on the door.]

**Alice**:

I'm so sorry, there is someone at the door. But do come by to see the silk gown I've bought!

[Alice hangs up and opens the door.]

**Alice**:

Good morning. I wasn't expecting you.

**Jay**:

Good morning Miss Emerson. 

[Jay falls silent.]

**Alice**:

What do you wish to say?

**Jay**:

Alice -- 

You said you would dance with me 

if I brought you a red rose.

Here is the reddest rose in

all the gardens, all the world.

Won't you please wear it tonight,

there -- there next to your heart.

And as we dance together, 

it'll tell you how I love you.

[Alice now falls silent.]

**Alice**:

I'm very sorry. Jay, I cannot accept your rose.

-----------------------------------------

**Alice**: Last night, William Milton asked me to the ball. He brought me roses of all colors, and also -- see these? 

[Alice shows Jay her matching pearl braclets.]

**Alice**: How could have I said no? Jay, you must understand.

**Jay**: No, I don't understand. Goodbye, Alice.

[Jay throws the rose on the ground, stomps on it, and begins to walk away. Alice stops herself from going after him and retreats inside the house. Gail enters and sees Jay, who is clearly upset. She stops to talk with him.

## The Exchange

**Gail**: 

Good morning, Jay. 

Something's the matter?

**Jay**:

Everything's all right.

Just all right.

**Gail**:

Are you going to the ball tonight?

**Jay**:

No, I'm afraid not. Enjoy yourself.

**Gail**:

Well, feel better. Goodbye, Jay.

[Jay exits. Gail walks up to the door of the house. She sees the discarded rose and picks it up to examine it tenderly. She pockets it and knocks on the door.]
