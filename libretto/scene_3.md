# Scene 3

In another garden of the college.

## White Rose Bush's Arietta

**White Rose Bush:**

May May's Lady bless evenings 

when bright moon beams 

on all creatures, awake, asleep.

Only pray she

who nests above me returns

to sing good night. 

-----------------

[The Nightingale enters, feeling flustered.]

**White Rose Bush:** Oh here she comes. Little Sister, what news in the gardens? What gossip from the bees and trees?

**Nightingale:** No time for gossip. 

**White Rose Bush:** You seem tired from flight. Rest a while here.

**Nightingale:** Have you seen a red rose anywhere? I have searched everywhere.

**White Rose Bush:** A red rose? The late frost had killed off all those vain little things. There's no use in looking. 

**Nightingale:** I must find one before dawn! Oh, my brother, I must tell you of my evening.

## The Nightingale and the Rose Bush's Duet

**Nightingale:**

In yonder garden, I heard

a young man sing

that his beloved desires

a rose bright red.

He weeps so deeply I fear

his heart will cleave.

My tunes of impish sadness

so pale to his;

from him I heard the truest 

of love's twitters.

**White Rose Bush:**

That is a moving story

but it cannot 

move nature to bloom the rose

that you now seek.

I have nothing to offer

but a white rose,

unless -- Jesu, halt my tongue --

**Nightingale:**

Oh do tell me!

**White Rose Bush:**

Little Sister, I cannot

bare to speak it.

[Nightingale falls silent with the realization. She tries to collect her thoughts.]

**Nightingale:**

I know what you are thinking:

I am not afraid.

**White Rose Bush:**

How I regret that soft word

spoken -- "unless" --

**Nightingale:**

Oh my brother,

shed for me a canvas rose --

your palest one --

then I will impale my breast

on its green thorns

so blood from my veins may stream

to stain it red. 

**White Rose Bush:**

Why do you speak such nonsense!

Little Sister,

what is this young man to you 

that you offer

yourself and all the songs that

you'll ever sing?

**Nightingale:**

To pay for roses with blood

seems but foolish.

Yet what's the heart of a bird

to that of man?

**White Rose Bush:**

What do you know about love

for one so young?

What do you know of dying,

the boundless dark?

## The Nightingale's Aria

**Nightingale:**

Morning air is sweetest

When light denudes the mist

o'er gleamed fields of wheat

then streams through windows

to warm the cheeks of babes.

Still, I ask, is morning

sweeter than lips joining?

Ha, what does a bird know!

I shan't ever know love

as I do day's dawning.

-------------

In chapel, I once heard

an anthem floating high

to the truss where I perched.

They sang, as clerks of old

had sung, as I now sing,

poorly, a faint echo:

"Love is as strong as death,

unyielding as the grave,

alighting flares of fire,

the very flame divine!"

-------------

This motet I believe 

as much as my thrush soul

can hold notes of beauty.

I believe as I glimpse

a mother cradling

her child as dusk descends.

I believe as I spy

a lover caressing

her swain as stars ascend.

In believing, I fear not the night.

--------------

**White Rose Bush:** Little Sister, I charge you! Do not awake rash thoughts!

**Nightingale:** Pray for me, my bother, it might be a slow death. 

**White Rose Bush:** Please listen to me! Do not--

**Nightingale:** Even evening will be light in God's country. But pray for me, for I dread pain.

**White Rose Bush:** Little Sister, Little Sister!

[She stabs herself on a thorn and bleeds onto a rose.]

**White Rose Bush:** Little Sister...

## The Nightingale's Motet

**Nightingale:**

And they sang -- 

_Fortis est ut mors dilectio,_

_dura sicut infernus aemulatio:_

_lampades ejus lampades_

_ignis atque divinum._

[She dies before completing the last word "divinum."]
