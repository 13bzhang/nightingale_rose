# Scene 3

In another garden of the college.

**White Rose Bush:**

What I would give for evenings 

when bright moon beams 

on all creatures, awake, asleep.

Only if she

who nests above me returns

to sing good night. 

[The Nightingale enters, feeling flustered.]

**White Rose Bush:**

Oh here she comes. Little Sister, what news in the gardens? What gossip from the bees and trees?

**Nightingale:**

No time for gossip. 

**White Rose Bush:**

You seem tired from flight. Rest a while here.

**Nightingale:**

Have you seen a red rose anywhere? I have searched everywhere. I must find one before dawn.

**White Rose Bush:**

A red rose? The late frost had killed off all those vain little things. There's no use in looking. 

**Nightingale:**

My brother, I must tell you of my evening.

## The Nightingale and the Rose Bush's Duet

**Nightingale:**

In yonder garden, I heard

a young man sing

that his beloved desires

a rose bright red.

He weeps so deeply I fear

his heart will cleave.

My tunes of childish sadness

so pale to his;

from him I heard the truest 

of love's twitters.

**White Rose Bush:**

That is a moving story

but it cannot 

move nature to bloom the rose

that you now seek.

I have nothing to offer

but a white rose,

unless -- Jesu, halt my tongue --

**Nightingale:**

Oh do tell me!

**White Rose Bush:**

Little Sister, I cannot

bare to speak it.

[Nightingale falls silent with the realization. She tries to collect her thoughts.]

**Nightingale:**

I know what you are thinking:

I am not afraid.

**White Rose Bush:**

How I regret that soft word

spoken -- "unless" --

**Nightingale:**

Oh my brother,

give me a lily-white rose --

your fairest one --

then I will impale my breast

on its green thorns

so blood from my veins may stream

to stain it red. 

**White Rose Bush:**

Why do you speak such nonsense!

Little Sister,

what is this young man to you 

that you offer

yourself and all the songs that

you'll ever sing?

**Nightingale:**

To pay for a rose with blood

seems but foolish.

Yet what's the heart of a bird

to that of man?

**Bush:**

What do you know about love

for one so young?

What do you know of dying,

the boundless dark?
