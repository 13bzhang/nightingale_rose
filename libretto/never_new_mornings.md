## The Nightingale's Last Song

The Nightingale:

Morning air is sweetest

When light unveils the mist

O'er gleamed fields of wheat

Then streams through windows

To warm the cheeks of babes.

Still, I ask, is morning

Sweeter than lips meeting?

Ha, what does a bird know!

I shan't ever know love

as I do day's dawning.

[Interlude]

In chapel, I once heard

An anthem floating high

To the truss where I perched.

They sang, as clerks of old

Had sung, as I now sing,

Poorly, a faint echo:

"Love is as strong as death,

Unyielding as the grave,

Weaving flashes of fire,

The very flame divine!"


[Insert lines about how the Nightingale imagines love and how she feels about not seeing another sunrise.]
