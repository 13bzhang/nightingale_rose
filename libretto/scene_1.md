## The May Madrigal 

All: 

Of all the days a jay might sing,

It’s May his treble maketh ring

The drips and drops of matin tunes

From April’s parting until June.

Gail:

I see a blue robin’s eggs

Upon the cherry tree.

What little eyes, little lives

Will open to gray skies?

Fannie:

I see a red robin’s breast

Brighter than crimson silk. 

How I wish to have a rose

As rich as robins' wings!

Gail, Jay, Tom:

Of all the days a scholar sings

It’s May when Great St Mary rings

The closing peals of vesper tunes 

And thus concludes our term in June!

Jay:

I see two hares so hurried,

Rushing across the field,

As close as lovers enthralled

In the grace of one another.

Tom:

I see the wily foxes

In shadows of the woods.

Spring breeds life but also bleeds

broken wings, brains, and hearts. 

All:

Of all the days that we could sing,

It’s May which muses us to ring,

To thrill so wildly shepherds' tunes,

On meadow grass un-hayed by June!

## Recitative

Tom:
A last hurrah before graduation, Jay. I’ll try to think of the good times--

Jay:
And not about your exams. Little sis, I’m not worried about you, though. 

Fannie:
Highest honors for Gail, I’m sure!

[Gail blushes and tries to hide it.]

Fannie:
Look at her! She’s blushing!

Gail:
Oh stop it, Fannie. 

Fannie:
Father says some are not meant for Latin or trig or verse. I guess I’m made for simpler things.

Tom (under his breath):
Or for finer things. 

Jay:
Nonsense! Fannie is for art, for music, for dancing. An aesthete she is!

[Fannie looks rather pleased with herself and does a little dance.]

Gail (rather shyly):
Jay, are you going to the ball on Friday?

Jay:
Of course, of course. (Suddenly feeling inspired.) Fannie, I’ve an extra ticket. Will you go with me?

[Gail tries to hide her disappointment. Fannie gives a devious smile.]

Fannie: 
Sure, I’ll go with you -- if you bring me a red, red rose. (Giggles.)

Jay:
Only the reddest rose for the dean's best rose.

[The sky thunders in the distance.]

Tom:
It’ll rain soon. We’d better head back soon. 

[They pack up their picnic supplies. Jay whistles while Gail hums to herself.]

Jay:
Tom and I’ll get the boat ready. Here, Fannie, let me take your basket. 

[Tom and Jay exit.]

Fannie:
Gail, what do you think of him?

Gail:
You mean Jay?

Fannie:
He’s a funny one, isn’t he?

Gail:
I think as he’s nice, so very nice when he smiles. 

Fannie:
Though he's only a poor choral scholar. Father would never approve.
